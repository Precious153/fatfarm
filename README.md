# Fat Farm

Fat Farm project is an agrictech mobile app I built for an Agritech conglomerate based in Bauchi, Nigeria.

## About the Project
Flutter was used to develop the app, and Dart was the programming language used.
Relevant Flutter widgets and properties were used where necessary (contained in lib files).

In the App, users can sign up if they don't have an account before, they can login if they already have an account,  they can view the list of produce in the market place, they are able to upload new produce if they wish to, and they can also delete produce from the market place.
